Carson Adams - HAMILTON - Othello


-- Implemented a fully recursive minimax algorithm (I was unable to do this 
last week).

-- Recurse to a depth of 6. 

-- Implemented a heuristic which weights the corners.

-- Optimized runtime.

I believe this strategy is straight-forward and not prone to failure or 
mistakes. 

As minimax relies upon one's opponent making 'ideal' moves, I considered 
adopting a strategy in which random moves are occasionally played; I found, 
however, that while this occasionally provides a slight advantage, it is more 
often a detriment.
